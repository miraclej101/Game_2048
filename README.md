# TP2048
Java game 2048 application based on Java 8. This project was made during the class of Oriented-Object Programming in my last year in a bachelor's degree of Computer Science.There's two modes of playing ; solo player and two players, as well as keep records of high score.

# Game Rules
(The 2048,2023). 
1. The game is played on a plain 4x4 grid with numbered tiles. At the beginning of the game, there are two tiles on the grid with the number 2. In this game, only numbers multiplied by 2 are used.
2. Use arrow keys to start moving tiles. Also, you can move them with your mouse or finger on touch screens. All tiles will slide in the selected direction. After each move, a new tile appears at a random location on the grid.
3. When one tile collides with another tile with the same number, they turn into one tile with a value of x2. For example, if you merge two tiles of 2, you get tile number 4. If you merge two tiles of 128, you get 256, and so on.
4. Your goal is to move and merge tiles, creating big numbers, until you get a tile numbered 2048. If you get 2048 in any square, you win the game!
5. The game is over if all the spots are filled with tiles and there is no way to connect the same tiles.
